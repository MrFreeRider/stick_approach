# El Niño is comming: Effects of a water over-price policy in Colombia during a extreme drought.
This paper examines the effects of a water-price regulation to face an strong "El Niño" season in Colombia. In 2014, the national government introduced a water overprice in regions were precipitation was lower for a typical dry season. I exploit the exogenous spatio-temporal source of policy variation using a unique panel data set of 1359 aqueducts from 2013 to 2016. On average, the new overprice price scheme produces water-savings in affected areas by 1.7\% per household per month. The effect is not only driven by the new regulation. I provide evidence that households contribute voluntarily, given the announcement of the weather shock. The effects vary wide with the local institutional arrangements under water is managed. State and community-based aqueducts undertake a better role in promoting water conservation, while in private-owned corporation's fail on it. The evidence here is useful to improve policy intervention in the future. In seeking to promote water conservation during droughts, policy-makers should explore the heterogeneity in water regimes to produce a more significant impact.
